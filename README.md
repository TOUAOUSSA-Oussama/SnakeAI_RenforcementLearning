# SnakeAI_RenforcementLearning

<h3> Description :</h3>
Snake AI is a game in which an agent (seprent) learns to maximise the score (number of wise apples) in a specific environment using reinforcement learning.

<h3> Specification </h3>
The environment is implemented using the Pygame library. The model responsible for the prediction of an action according to the state of the agent in the environment is implemented using the Pytorch framework. It is a feedforward model consisting of an input layer, hidden layer and output layer.

<h3> Get started </h3>
1. install the dependencies provided in the requirements.txt file
<br>
2. run agent.py (python agent.py)
